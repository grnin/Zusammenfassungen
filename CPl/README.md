# Information for CAMPLA Exams
This summary contains links to cppreference.com. This site is available offline at `C:/cppreference` in the CAMPLA exam environment. To ensure that the links also work in the exam, there is an “EXAM_MODE” flag in the `00_CPR_Settings.typ` file. Setting it to true converts the links to the offline versions.

If you don't want to customize the summary yourself, this repository contains two PDFs, one with online links and one with offline links.

It is however worth checking whether the offline version is still at the same path during the CAMPLA testing session (scheduled during a CPl exercise session in the last weeks of the semester).
